At [edjing](http://www.edjing.com), we are used to have great arguments about coding styles. Some of us argue for a brace at the end of the line, where others want to put it on the following line. When you want to put a full stop to this kind of discussion, you need to find a good *reference* documentation.

Coding Styles is here for this. This website references conventions and guidelines for writing code in a variety of languages. Any kind of contribution is welcomed and anybody can submit an issue or a pull-request to add a language, a coding style reference, etc.
